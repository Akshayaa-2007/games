# AI Use Case – BFS & DFS

## Overview  
This project demonstrates how two fundamental Artificial Intelligence search algorithms — *Breadth-First Search (BFS)* and *Depth-First Search (DFS)* — are used to solve real-world style problems.  
Instead of only writing the algorithms, they are deployed in two interactive applications:

1. Maze Navigation System  
2. 8-Puzzle Problem Solver  

These two problems represent the two main areas of AI:
- Navigation in environments  
- Planning in state spaces

## Use Case 1 – Maze-game  
Link:  
https://github.com/Akshayaa-2007/games.git  

### Problem  
The maze represents a real-world environment where an intelligent agent (player) must move from a *start* to a *goal* while avoiding obstacles.  
This models problems such as:
- Robot navigation  
- Game AI movement  
- GPS routing  
- Path planning  

Each cell in the maze is a node, and each possible move is an edge.

### BFS in the Maze  
Breadth-First Search explores all nearby positions first.  
In the maze, BFS guarantees the *shortest path* from the player to the goal.  
This is useful in:
- Robots using minimum energy  
- Navigation systems  
- Games requiring optimal paths  

The BFS option in the game shows this shortest path visually.

### DFS in the Maze  
Depth-First Search explores one path deeply before trying others.  
It does not guarantee the shortest route but it shows how AI can explore and backtrack through a large environment.

This is useful in:
- Exploration  
- Search in unknown areas  
- Decision-making systems

## Use Case 2 – 8-Puzzle Problem Solver  
Link:  
https://github.com/Akshayaa-2007/games.git 

### Problem  
The 8-puzzle is a classic Artificial Intelligence problem.  
The goal is to arrange tiles from 1 to 8 in order by sliding them into the empty space.

This models:
- Automated planning  
- Problem solving  
- State-space search  

Each tile configuration is a state, and each move is an action.

### BFS in the Puzzle  
BFS explores all states step by step.  
It always finds the solution with the *minimum number of moves*, which is important in:
- AI planning  
- Scheduling  
- Optimization problems  

The BFS button in the game shows the optimal solution path.

### DFS in the Puzzle  
DFS explores move sequences deeply before trying other options.  
A depth-limit is used to prevent infinite searching.  
This shows how AI explores possibilities to reach a goal state.

## Use Case 3 – City Route Finder
Link:
https://github.com/Gopikagovind/AI-Lab/blob/main/city_routes.py

This application simulates a real-world city navigation system.
Cities are nodes and roads are edges.

BFS is used to find the shortest number of roads between two cities.
DFS is used to explore possible routes.

This represents GPS navigation, delivery routing, and map-based AI systems.

## Conclusion  

These two programs demonstrate how BFS and DFS are used in real AI systems:

| Problem | BFS | DFS |
|-------|------|------|
Maze | Finds shortest path | Explores routes |
8-Puzzle | Finds minimum moves | Explores move sequences |

Together, they show how AI search algorithms are applied in:
- Robotics  
- Games  
- Planning systems  
- Intelligent decision-making  

This is a practical deployment of BFS and DFS, not just theoretical code.
